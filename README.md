# EZC-R-Programming

## Purpose of the Repository

Welcome to EZC-R-Programming repository where you will find necessary data sets for our projects to proceed!

## Acknowledgement/Data Set Description

1. We thank EZC for sponsoring this educational endeavor and we hope everyone feel worthwhile by taking this `R` journey with me.
2. External Data Source:
  - For our **COVID-19 report project**, the source dataset is from [John Hopkins CSSE Public Dataset](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). 
  We thank them for such amazing and clean work on their data set generation. 
  - For our regression model, the dataset is from [SRK Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset). 
  We thank SRK for putting multiple features of the COVID-19 together for us to perform analysis.

There are some additional data sets created by myself simply to showcase some functionalities of `R` and some real world problem that you might encounter when using such a statistical analytic programming language.

- `dota2Dataset` is provided by the famous [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php). This data set will be used for us to perform data cleaning and practice `R` syntax.
- `ZM.csv` is the time series of stock bid/ask price of ZOOM Inc. since its initial public offering (IPO) provided by [Yahoo Finance Zoom Stock Ticker](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ZM/history?period1=1577836800&period2=1587600000&interval=1d&filter=history&frequency=1d). This file will be used for us to conduct return and volatility forecast on stock investment.
- `BondData.csv` is a set of simulated bond features originally provided in a `Matlab` table. I have transformed it into more accessible `.csv` data format. This data set will be used for us to discuss about fixed income instruments, in terms of pricing, interest rate sensitivities, and arbitrarge finding.

## Finished Projects

The source code of the finished projects will not be disclosed in this repository, but the finished analysis will be uploaded here for future references. 
If you would like see the source code of the programs that generated these analysis, please contact Weixi Zhuo via [](w3zhuo@uwaterloo.ca).

## Term of Use

The data sets presented in this repository are either public by their origins or made public by myself. Feel free to use them for the future, 
as long as not criminal. PLEASE.
