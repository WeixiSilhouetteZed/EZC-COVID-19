## Purpose of the Repository

Welcome to EZC-COVID-19 repository where you will find necessary data sets for our projects to proceed!

## Acknowledgement

1. We thank EZC for sponsoring this educational endeavor and we hope everyone feel worthwhile by taking this `R` journey with me.
2. External Data Source:
  - For our **COVID-19 report project**, the source dataset is from [John Hopkins CSSE Public Dataset](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). 
  We thank them for such amazing and clean work on their data set generation. 
  - For our regression model, the dataset is from [SRK Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset). 
  We thank SRK for putting multiple features of the COVID-19 together for us to perform analysis.

There are some additional data sets created by myself simply to showcase some functionalities of `R` and some real world problem that you might encounter when using such a statistical analytic programming language.

## Finished Projects

The source code of the finished projects will not be disclosed in this repository, but the finished analysis will be uploaded here for future references.
